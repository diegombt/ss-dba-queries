# Microsoft Azure Fundamentals

## Module 4 - Azure Pricing and Support → summary
In this module, you learned about Azure Pricing and Support. We defined Azure subscriptions and detailed the various Azure subscription options and uses; explored purchasing Azure Products and Services; and examined factors that affect Azure costs and how you can minimize them. Additionally, we detailed Azure support plans and channels, and outlined Azure SLAs and how you can improve their application. Finally, we followed the service life cycle in Azure from the preview phase through general availability to update.

### Azure subscriptions
In this lesson, we defined an Azure subscription as a logical unit of services, and we detailed the free and paid subscriptions that suit different customer requirements. Additionally, you learned that using Azure requires a subscription and that billing and management policies apply on a per-subscription basis for accounts with multiple subscriptions. We defined management groups as containers for collections of Azure resources, arranged hierarchically. Lastly, we discussed how you can apply governance and access polices to each management group.

### Planning and managing costs
In this lesson, we discussed the four Azure customer types, which include Free Account, Enterprise, Web Direct, and Cloud Solution Providers (CSP), and how those customer types determine purchasing and billing options for products and services. We introduced Azures pay-for-what-you-use model and discussed how usage meters determine costs. We also examined the factors that affect costs including resource type, first-party and third-party service categories, and location. Lastly, we discussed how you can minimize your Azure costs by using tools such as Azure's Pricing and Cost of Ownership (TCO) calculators, and products such as Azure Advisor recommendations and Azure Reservations.

### Support options available with Azure
In this lesson, you learned that all customers receive free billing and subscription support, and free access to documentation and self-help. We discussed how you can extend Azure free support with a paid support plan, like Developer, Standard, Professional Direct, and Premier Support. You discovered that available support-plan options can vary between Azure customer and subscription type. Lastly, you learned how you can get additional help by opening a support ticket, by visiting alternative support channels (such as MSDN Forums and Stack Overflow), or from the Azure Knowledge Center.

### Azure SLAs
In this lesson, you learned how SLAs set performance targets specific to each Azure product and service. You saw how SLA performance targets typically range from 99.9 percent (three nines) to 99.99 percent (four nines), and you learned that SLAs define how Microsoft responds if an Azure product or service under-performs. You also learned how to create your own Application SLAs and how increasing availability can also raise the cost and complexity of your Azure solution.

### Service life cycle in Azure
In this lesson, you learned about the components of the Azure service life cycle, and how Microsoft offers public and private previews of Azure features for evaluation purposes. You also learned how you can access the Azure Preview Features page and that successfully tested features are made available to Azure customers through GA releases. Finally, you learned how to get details of the latest updates to Azure products, services, and features from the Azure Updates web page.
